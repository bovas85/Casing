# Casing - UI framework for Framer

Casing is a framework for Framer which helps you with managing:

* components - modular pieces of UI
* screens - which are sets of components
* data - mutable and immutable information shown in prototype


# Installation

Copy over following files to your `PROJECT_NAME.framer/modules/` directory:

* `Casing.coffee` - REQUIRED. Contains the entirety of Casing's code
* `FrmrDatePicker.coffee` - if you want to use a date-picker in your prototype
* `FrmrDropdown.coffee` - if you want to use a drop-down in your prototype
* `FrmrTextInput.coffee` - if you want to use a text-input in your prototype

![Modules Example][modules_example]

If you're new to modules in Framer, the default directory named 'modules' generated on a Framer project creation will already contain a myModule.coffee file with instructions on how to get started. The Casing.coffee file is required in this directory.

# Getting Started

To be added soon...!
